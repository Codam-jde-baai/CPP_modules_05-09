Merge inesrtion - Ford Johnson algo


Clarified Steps:
Step 1: Group the integers into pairs.
Step 2: Sort each pair so that the larger number is in the first position.
Step 3: Create a sorted list L by performing binary insertion of the larger numbers (the numbers in the first position of each pair).
Step 4: Insert the smaller numbers (from the second position of each pair) into the appropriate place in the sorted list L (again, using binary insertion).


Take aways:
- On small input lists are significantly faster as they dont need to allocate memory.
- On bigger inputs vectors are signficantly faster since they can use binary search method instead of iterating through a list one by one.

## generate random input that you cna replicate 

shuf -i 1-100000 -n 3000 | tr "\n" " " > input
./PmergeMe $(cat input) 


or instantly run random input

./PmergeMe `shuf -i 1-100000 -n 3000 | tr "\n" " "`
