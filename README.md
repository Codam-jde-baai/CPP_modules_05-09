# CPP Modules 05-09: Advanced C++ Techniques and Concepts

Unlike in CPP 00-04, for these exercises, I was already familiar with writing a simple class and using concepts like inheritance. CPP 05-09 encouraged me to write more complex programs with the assumption that core C++ is well understood. These modules focus on advanced C++ features and techniques, helping to broaden my understanding of the language.

Overall these exercises focused on templates, type-casting, containers and simple algorithms.

## The Modules

Below is a brief overview of each module and the key concepts they cover. These exercises were sometimes relatively simple and sometimes more complex like Modules09. After I finished all of these I had a good base to write bigger projects like webserv in C++.

### Module05

- **Assignment**: Error handlind, inheritance, virtual classes
- **Key learning points**:
  - Using try-catch blocks for error management.
  - Implementing inheritances and calling classes
  - Overwriting a virtual function and avoiding writing the same code twice.

### Module06

- **Assignment**: Mastering type casting in C++.
- **Key learning points**:
  - Understanding and applying different types of casting: static_cast, dynamic_cast, const_cast, and reinterpret_cast.
  - Implementing safe and efficient type conversions.
  - Exploring the implications of implicit and explicit casting.

### Module07

- **Assignment**: Advanced object-oriented programming with templates.
- **Key learning points**:
  - In-depth exploration of templates and generic programming.
  - Implementing template functions and classes for code reusability.
  - Understanding template specialization and its applications.

### Module08

- **Assignment**: Exploring advanced template usage and STL algorithms.
- **Key learning points**:
  - Implementing a function template to search for elements within standard containers using iterators.
  - Designing a class template to manage a collection of numbers and calculate spans between them.
  - Creating a custom stack class that supports iteration, demonstrating the integration of STL container features with custom data structures.
  - Understanding the use of different types of iterators and their applications in generic programming.

### Module09

For CPP09 we had to use a different container in each assignment. Encouraging the understanding and proper usage of different containers.

- **Assignment**: Algorithm design and implementation.
- **Key learning points**:
  - For ex00 I used std::map container to match 2 data files 
  - for ex01 we had to write a RPN calculator, I used a stack as the RPN method always uses the lasst in first out for calculations
  - for ex02 I used vectors to build a merge-insertion sort algorithm based on the Ford-Johnson method for sorting.

These modules have been crucial in enhancing my C++ skills, providing a deeper understanding of the language's capabilities.
